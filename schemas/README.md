# Schemas

JSON Schema 2020-12 contracts for the core objects. `$id`s live under `https://yeonjae.studio/schemas/`;
cross-references use relative names (`common.schema.json#/$defs/...`). Validate with
`python tools/validate-planning-package.py` (requires `jsonschema>=4.18`).

Text fields are **language-neutral** (`text`, `summary`, `statement`, `description`). Where the language of
user-authored text may vary, a `language` code (and optional `text_en` working paraphrase) accompanies it.
**Manuscript text follows the project manuscript language** — `en` or `ko` (`common.manuscriptLanguage`, OUTPUT-LANG-001, ADR-0054). Korean appears only as
terminology source terms and optional native-script names.

## Rules for implementers

1. Generate TypeScript types from these files (e.g., `json-schema-to-typescript`) or maintain Zod schemas
   with an equivalence test; never hand-fork.
2. Adding a field: add here first, bump the schema's documentation, update examples, then code.
3. Enums are closed lists on purpose (frames, stances, severities, quality dimensions, register shift
   reasons). Extending one is an ADR.
4. Do not reintroduce language-suffixed primary fields; use `language` metadata instead.
5. Offsets are Unicode code points into NFC text (ADR-0030); fixture evidence is checked against
   `examples/fixture/manuscripts/` by the validator.
6. Canon-delta payloads are proposals: `canon-delta-payloads.schema.json` mirrors each stored schema minus
   the ids/version fields the commit assigns. Add a field to the stored schema first, then to the proposal.
